# Image compression using K-means

This repository features code that applies K-means clustering to compressing images. It also creates visualizations of the compression process.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

All the libraries required for this project can be found in the [requirements.txt]() file

### File structure:

In this repository there are four folders

- [compressed_img]() : This is used to save all compressed images as a result of running k-means
- [gifs](): This is where all the animated gifs generated by the algorithm get stored
- [input_img](): The algorithm collects the input image to be compressed form this folder
- [iterations](): This is where each frame of the animated gif for the compression process is stored.

The main file for running the image compression algorithm using K-means is Image Compression.ipynb. It was written with Jupyter notebook and explains in detail the algorithm, how it works and how to modify the code to work for your image. The algorithm can handle jpg, png, and gif image formats.

### Visulizations

The algorithm generates three main visualizations:

- Color of centroids after running K-means

- A visual and size comparison between the original image and compressed image

- An animation that shows the process of compressing the image
